Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are ubiquitous, with examples ranging
from industrial robot arms to autonomous home vacuum cleaners.
Unlike a personal computer or a cloud server, CPS interact directly with the
physical world and control physical processes.
Their correctness criteria are determined as much by the physics of their
environment as by the internal state of their program. 
For example, an engine control unit in a car, which decides the amount of fuel
to be injected, must adapt its decision logic and frequency with the engine RPM.
</p>

<p>
Many such CPS must be inherently <em>distributed</em>, are subject to stringent
<em>real-time</em> constraints, and must remain fully functional in the face of
transient and, to some extent, permanent subsystem failures.
In addition to satisfying highest reliability expectations,
<em>safety-critical</em> CPS are also often subject to certification requirements
and/or formal validation efforts.
That is, not only must they work in practice, but it must also be possible to
formally establish their correctness <em>a priori</em>.
Going forward, the reliability of <em>learning-enabled components</em> and
<em>security</em> of networked CPS also ought to be first-order safety concerns,
like timing and fault tolerance has been in so far.
</p>

<!--<p>
Going forward, in next-generation CPS,
ML reliability and security also ought to be first-order safety concerns.
ML is incredibly powerful, it is widely used with the proliferation of
open-source ML models and frameworks, but it is inherently difficult to assess
its reliability.
Likewise, the use of fully automated CPS in manufacturing promises to improve
productivity manyfold by taking humans out of the loop,
but increased automation heightens the risk of remote attacks.
</p>-->

<p>
The focus of this course is to <em>explore the design principles that allow the
construction of analytically sound and functionally safe
distributed real-time systems</em>,
which are integral to a plethora of contemporary safety-critical CPS.
To this end, we will reason about, compare, and contrast the techniques from
both the distributed systems and real-time systems literature.

<dl><dt>Prerequisites</dt>
<dd>
This is a research-oriented course intended for Masters and Ph.D. students in
Computer Science.
Students are expected to have at least an undergraduate-level understanding of
systems, such as operating systems, computer networks, or distributed systems.
Prior exposure to real-time computing, embedded systems, or cyber-physical
systems is recommended but not required.
Enterprising Bachelors students who fulfill the above pre-requisites,
i.e., CPSC 313 and CPSC 317, are welcome to participate.
In addition, a certain level of proficiency in discrete mathematics and probability,
and some background in algorithms and complexity of computation, typically at the level of CPSC 320,
is also expected.
</dd>
<!--<dd>

Design of safety-critical CPS requires a strong emphasis on functional correctness.
These guarantees are often derived from formal modeling and mathematical analysis of systems.
A majority of the reading material is therefore expecte

If you do not satisfy the necessary prerequisites but would still like to take
the course, send me an email summarizing your interest in the course, your
experience working on any related topic, and, if you are from another department,
a list of courses related to computer science that you have taken.

									<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
This is a seminar-style graduate course.
The primary goal is to prepare you to do research,
by encouraging you to read and discuss research papers,
and by giving you an opportunity to carry out an open-ended course project in
the broad areas of distributed and real-time computing.
Therefore, the evaluation for this course consists of two main components.
<strong>The grading scheme is still tentative.</strong>
</p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Class participation (35%)</dt>
<dd>Students are expected to read the assigned reading material before each class
and come prepared with questions and a critical analysis of the papers.
In the class, we will discuss the reading material and applications of the
ideas beyond the papers.
Each paper will also be assigned a discussion lead who is resonsible for presenting
a short overview of the paper to kickstart the discussion (more on this later).
You will be graded based on the quality of your participation and your presentation.
See the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section for the reading material.
</dd>
</dl></p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Project (65%)</dt>
<dd>The course project must be done in teams of 1-3.
The goal of the project is to conduct original research.
You may talk to the instructor for some ideas that are well-scoped for a
course project.
You may also undertake a project overlapping with your own research, if you can
demonstrate how it is related to and/or influenced by some topic from this
course.
The project deliverables and their relative weightage is given below.
See the <a href="#project">Project</a> section for detailed instructions.
<p><dl><dd>
  <ul>
  <li>Research proposal (20%)</li>
	<li>Proposal presentation (10%)</li>
  <li>Final presentation (20%)</li>
  <li>Final report (50%)</li>
  </ul>
</dd></dl></p>
</dd>
</dl></p>

                  <a name="schedule"></a>
									<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>
Here is a tentative list of papers to be discussed in the class.
The goal is to discuss every week two papers, typically,
one from the real-time computing literature and one paper from the distributed systems literature,
but that follow a common theme (e.g., that focus on similar type of faults
or that focus on similar safety properties).
The URLs take you to the official page of publishers, such as IEEE or ACM. You should be able to get the PDFs from there using your UBC credentials. Nonetheless, I will also be uploading all papers to the <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/123466/files/folder/papers">UBC Canvas</a> course page.

									<h2>Project</h2>

<p>You must propose a research project with a problem statment and a research
plan, conduct the research, and write up your research results and experience.
If you need any specific equipment, software, or tools for your project,
please speak to us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It is okay if you do not complete a full-fledged project by the end of the term.
The goal is to learn how to go from a one-line problem to a fully scoped out
research problem, then try and identify potential solutions.
If a topic is difficult and you do not reach the practical implementation stage,
that will be fine.</p>


<p>
There are four deliverables in the project.
Each written component must be formatted using the
<a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author">LIPIcs style template</a>.
You are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX for typesetting.
</p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Research Proposal</dt>
<dd>The proposal should be minimally four pages (excluding references)
and must include the following sections.
<p><dl><dd>
  <ul>
  <li>Introduction: Explain what is the problem, why is it an important
  problem, and why are you interested in this problem? Describe the background
  and motivation for the problem you are interested in, and pose a concrete
  research question.</li>
  <li>Related work: Do a brief survey of related work in the problem space.
  This includes papers that solve the same problem but with a different
  approach and papers whose ideas you build upon in your own work. Compare and
  contrast your own proposed solution with each related work. If you have not
  read all the related work by the time of proposal submission, make a list of
  papers that you will be covering by the final report submission.</li>
  <li>Proposed solution: Describe your proposed solution and planned
  methodology to answer the research question at a high level.</li>
  <li>Evaluation: Describe how you plan to evaluate your proposed solution.
  What kind of data, plots, or proofs artifacts would you generate from the
  evaluation?</li>
  </ul>
</dd></dl></p>
</dd>
</dl></p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Proposal Presentation</dt>
<dd>Each group will give a short presentation followed by Q&A and feedback from the class. Focus on presenting:
<p><dl><dd>
  <ul>
  <li>Problem: What is the problem they are working on? (Include the basic context that is required to understand the problem statement.)</li>
  <li>Motivation: Why is an important problem and why did you choose to work on this problem?</li>
  <li>Key idea: What is the key idea of your solution?</li>
  <li>Deliverable: What is the expected final deliverable?</li>
  </ul>
</dd></dl></p>
</dd>
</dl></p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Final Presentation</dt>
<dd>Each group will give a short presentation followed by Q&A from
the class. The presentation would be similar to a conference or workshop talk.
Focus on presenting the motivation, the problem, one key idea of your project,
and the results.</dd>
</dl></p>

<p><dl>
<dt>Final Report</dt>
<dd>The final report must include similar sections as in the proposal but written
in a way to describe what has been done. Additionally, add a section describing
the limitations of your work and how the research can be extended (by you or
someone else) in the future.</dd>

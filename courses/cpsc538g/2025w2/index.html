<p>
	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are ubiquitous, with examples ranging
	from industrial robot arms to autonomous home vacuum cleaners.
	Unlike a personal computer or a cloud server, CPS interact directly with the
	physical world and control physical processes.
	Their correctness criteria are determined as much by the physics of their
	environment as by the internal state of their program. 
	For example, an engine control unit in a car, which decides the amount of fuel
	to be injected, must adapt its decision logic and frequency with the engine RPM.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Many CPS, such as those used in fully autonomous systems, can require nontrivial
	amounts of computation and physical sensing and actuation every few milliseconds,
	and even a single faulty or delayed actuation can be fatal.
	<em>Real-time computing</em> is about ensuring that an implementation of such CPS on
	specific hardware always complies with the timing requirements,
	e.g., the software processes responsible for sensing, control, and actuation must be
	activated every <em>T<sub>time-period</sub></em> milliseconds,
	and, upon activation, their combined execution must finish within
	<em>T<sub>deadline</sub></em> milliseconds.
	This is challenging because on most platforms, right from the microarchitecture to
	programming languages, operating systems, and networking protocols, timing is a
	performance metric, not a safety property.
	Engineers thus rely on timer interrupts and priorities to control timing in software
	and schedulability analyses to determine if timing requirements will always be met.
	</p>
	
	<!-- <p>
	Many such CPS must be inherently <em>distributed</em>, are subject to stringent
	<em>real-time</em> constraints, and must remain fully functional in the face of
	transient and, to some extent, permanent subsystem failures.
	In addition to satisfying highest reliability expectations,
	<em>safety-critical</em> CPS are also often subject to certification requirements
	and/or formal validation efforts.
	That is, not only must they work in practice, but it must also be possible to
	formally establish their correctness <em>a priori</em>.
	Going forward, the reliability of <em>learning-enabled components</em> and
	<em>security</em> of networked CPS also ought to be first-order safety concerns,
	like timing and fault tolerance has been in so far.
	</p> -->
	
	<p>
	The focus of this course is to <em>explore the design principles that allow the
	construction of analytically sound and temporally safe real-time computing systems</em>,
	which are integral to a plethora of safety-critical CPS.
	To this end, we will reason about, compare, and contrast different scheduling algorithms
	and mathematical analysis techniques from the real-time systems literature.

This is a beginner-friendly course intended to introduce you to the field of real-time systems.
That said, students are expected to have at least an undergraduate-level understanding of
systems, such as operating systems, computer networks, or distributed systems.
Prior exposure to real-time computing, embedded systems, or cyber-physical
systems is recommended but not required.
Enterprising Bachelors students who fulfill the above pre-requisites,
i.e., CPSC 313, CPSC 317 or CPSC 416, are welcome to participate.
In addition, a certain level of proficiency in discrete mathematics and probability,
and some background in algorithms and complexity of computation, typically at the level of CPSC 320,
is also expected.

<h2>Grading (tentative)</h2>

<h3>CPSC 538G</h3>

<!-- <p>
This is a graduate course.
The primary goal is to prepare you to do research,
by encouraging you to read and discuss research papers,
and by giving you an opportunity to carry out an open-ended course project in
the broad areas of distributed and real-time computing.
For students who are new to real-time computing or to software systems research (especially undergraduates),
I will also cover the basics of real-time scheduling over a series of lectures during the first half of the course.
Therefore, the evaluation for this course consists of three main components.
</p> -->

<!-- <strong>Note: Paper Presentation and Participation components will apply only to students enrolled in CPSC 538G,
as one of the primary goals of a graduate course is to prepare you to do reserach by encouraging you to read, discuss, and critique research papers.
Likewise, the final exam component will apply only to students enrolled in CPEN 432.</strong> -->
	
<p><dl><dt>Take-home Homework Assignments (10%)</dt><dd>
For the first half of the course, I will create a few take-home assignments to ensure
that you all understand the basic material taught in the class.
Assignments are to be handed in individually.
</dd></dl></p>

<p><dl><dt>Paper Presentation (20%)</dt><dd>
During the second half of the course, we will discuss several research papers on
various topics in the field of real-time systems.
	We will discuss one (occasionally, two) papers per day, some classical, some recent.
Each paper will be assigned one or two discussion leads,
who will be expected to read and understand the paper in detail,
	and who will be responsible for presenting the key ideas of the paper.
</dd></dl></p>

<p><dl><dt>Participation (10%)</dt><dd>
Participation includes engaging in discussion over Piazza, in the ``lectures'', and in presentations of your peers.
Students are expected to read the assigned reading material before each class, post initial questions and discussion points on Piazza, and respond to others' questions on Piazza and in class.
Please submit your questions and initial discussion points on Piazza by 11:00 AM one day before the class.
</dd></dl></p>
	
<p><dl>
<dt>Research Project (60%)</dt>
<dd>The research project must be done in teams of 1-2.
The goal of the research project is to conduct original research related to scheduling or real-time computing in operating or distributed systems (broadly construed).
You may talk to the instructor for some ideas that are well-scoped for a course project.
<!-- You may also undertake a project overlapping with your own research, if you can
demonstrate how it is related to and/or influenced by some topic from this
course. -->
Your research project can have one of three flavors.
(1) <em>Exploration</em>: You may undertake a project overlapping with your own research, if you can demonstrate how it is related to and/or influenced by some topic from this course.
You may describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of your solution in the project report.
You may optionally submit an artifact along with the report.
(2) <em>Replication</em>: You may mechanize, verify, or reproduce the results of an existing real-time systems solution. In this case, you are expected to submit a functional artifact and results along with the project report.
(3) <em>Systematization</em>: You may write an SoK (systematization-of-knowledge) paper on a topic, reviewing the literature and identifying potential directions for future research. Real SoKs tend to cover ~100 papers; an SoK in the course might cover at least 15-20 papers.
The deliverables include:
<!-- You must submit a <em>fully functional and reproducible artifact</em> along with the final report. -->
<p><dl><dd>
	<ul>
	<li>Project proposal (5%)</li>
	<li>Mid-term presentation (15%)</li>
	<li>Final report and artifact (40%)</li>
	</ul>
</dd></dl></p>
<strong>Students enrolled in CPSC 538G may choose to do the CPEN 432 FreeRTOS Project (outlined below) instead of a research project.
	Undergraduates, especially, may decide to (and are recommended to) choose this option. Please consult with me before taking this decision,
	as we have limited embedded hardware available for the FreeRTOS Project.</strong>
</dd>
</dl></p>

<h3>CPEN 432</h3>

<p><dl><dt>Take-home Homework Assignments (10%)</dt><dd>
For the first half of the course, I will create a few take-home assignments to ensure
that you all understand the basic material taught in the class.
Assignments are to be handed in individually.
</dd></dl></p>

<p><dl><dt>Mid-term Quiz (10%) and Final Exam (20%)</dt><dd>
These will be written or CBTF exams covering all aspects of the course, including the fundamentals of real-time system design, advanced topics covered as part of the research paper discussions, and some aspects of the FreeRTOS project.
</dd></dl></p>

<p><dl>
<dt>FreeRTOS Project (60%)</dt>
<dd>This will involve understanding the internals of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system kernel,
extending it to support the <em>Earliest Deadline First</em> dynamic-priority scheduling algorithm,
the <em>Stack Resource Policy</em> for real-time locking, and the <em>Constant Bandwidth Server</em>
for co-scheduling real-time periodic and non-real-time aperiodic tasks.
The underlying scheduling theory for each of the assignments will be taught during the first half of the course,
or else extensive documentation and help will be provided.
These tentative programming assignments and their relative weight are summarized below.
Like the research project, you must also submit a <em>fully functional and reproducible artifact</em> along with each assignment submission.
<!-- Remember that a substantial percentage of your grade will be assigned during the demos, so prepare a nice demo! -->
<p><dl><dd>
	<ul>
	<li>Earliest Deadline First (EDF) (15%)</li>
	<li>Stack Resource Policy (SRP) (15%)</li>

<h3>Module 3: Advanced Topics</h3>

<p>
	In this module, we will spend some time understanding scheduling in Linux, and then discussing a few recent research papers on the design of learning-enabled components for real-time systems, especially automotive systems.
	Depending on the number of students enrolled in CPSC 538G, I may teach some of the topics, or we may schedule multiple paper presentations per day.
Note: If you would like to discuss a specific topic that is not covered in the course, but still relevant to real-time systems research, e.g., security of embedded platforms or complexity and hardness analysis of real-time scheduling problems, I am happy to update the schedule.

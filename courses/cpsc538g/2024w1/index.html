<p>
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are ubiquitous, with examples ranging
from industrial robot arms to autonomous home vacuum cleaners.
Unlike a personal computer or a cloud server, CPS interact directly with the
physical world and control physical processes.
Their correctness criteria are determined as much by the physics of their
environment as by the internal state of their program. 
For example, an engine control unit in a car, which decides the amount of fuel
to be injected, must adapt its decision logic and frequency with the engine RPM.
</p>

<p>
Many CPS, such as those used in fully autonomous systems, can require nontrivial
amounts of computation and physical sensing and actuation every few milliseconds,
and even a single faulty or delayed actuation can be fatal.
<em>Real-time computing</em> is about ensuring that an implementation of such CPS on
specific hardware always complies with the timing requirements,
e.g., the software processes responsible for sensing, control, and actuation must be
activated every <em>T<sub>time-period</sub></em> milliseconds,
and, upon activation, their combined execution must finish within
<em>T<sub>deadline</sub></em> milliseconds.
This is challenging because on most platforms, right from the microarchitecture to
programming languages, operating systems, and networking protocols, timing is a
performance metric, not a safety property.
Engineers thus rely on timer interrupts and priorities to control timing in software
and schedulability analyses to determine if timing requirements will always be met.
</p>

<!-- <p>
Many such CPS must be inherently <em>distributed</em>, are subject to stringent
<em>real-time</em> constraints, and must remain fully functional in the face of
transient and, to some extent, permanent subsystem failures.
In addition to satisfying highest reliability expectations,
<em>safety-critical</em> CPS are also often subject to certification requirements
and/or formal validation efforts.
That is, not only must they work in practice, but it must also be possible to
formally establish their correctness <em>a priori</em>.
Going forward, the reliability of <em>learning-enabled components</em> and
<em>security</em> of networked CPS also ought to be first-order safety concerns,
like timing and fault tolerance has been in so far.
</p> -->

<p>
The focus of this course is to <em>explore the design principles that allow the
construction of analytically sound and temporally safe real-time computing systems</em>,
which are integral to a plethora of safety-critical CPS.
To this end, we will reason about, compare, and contrast different scheduling algortihms
and mathematical analyses techniques from the real-time systems literature.

<dl><dt>Prerequisites</dt>
<dd>
This is a research-oriented course intended for Masters and Ph.D. students in
Computer Science.
Students are expected to have at least an undergraduate-level understanding of
systems, such as operating systems, computer networks, or distributed systems.
Prior exposure to real-time computing, embedded systems, or cyber-physical
systems is recommended but not required.
Enterprising Bachelors students who fulfill the above pre-requisites,
i.e., CPSC 313, CPSC 317 or CPSC 416, are welcome to participate.
In addition, a certain level of proficiency in discrete mathematics and probability,
and some background in algorithms and complexity of computation, typically at the level of CPSC 320,
is also expected.

Design of safety-critical CPS requires a strong emphasis on functional correctness.
These guarantees are often derived from formal modeling and mathematical analysis of systems.

<h2>Grading (tentative)</h2>

<h3>Main Components</h3>

<p>
	This is a graduate course.
	The primary goal is to prepare you to do research,
	by encouraging you to read and discuss research papers,
	and by giving you an opportunity to carry out an open-ended course project in
	the broad areas of distributed and real-time computing.
	For students who are new to real-time computing or to software systems research (especially undergraduates),
	I will also cover the basics of real-time scheduling over a series of lectures during the first half of the course.
	Therefore, the evaluation for this course consists of three main components.
	<!-- <strong>The grading scheme is still tentative.</strong> -->
	</p>
	
<p><dl>
	<dt>Assignments (10%)</dt>
		<dd>
		For the first half of the course, I will create few take-home assignments to ensure
		that you all understand the basic material taught in the class.
		Assignments are to be handed in individually.
		See the <a href="#assignments">Assignments</a> section for detailed instructions.
		</dd>
	</dl>
</p>

	<p><dl>
	<dt>Paper presentation and participation (30%)</dt>
	<dd>
	During the second half of the course, we will discuss several research papers on
	various topics in the field of real-time systems.
	We will discuss one (occassionally, two) papers per day.
	Each paper will be assigned a discussion lead who is expected to read and understand
	the paper in detail, and who is resonsible for presenting the key ideas of the paper.
	Students who are not the discussion lead for a paper are expected to read the paper
	beforehand (at the very least, skim through its key sections)
	and come prepared with questions.
	<!-- In the class, we will discuss the key contributions in the papers as well as
	applications of the key ideas beyond the papers. -->
	You will be graded based on the <em>quality</em> of your presentation and your participation.
	<!-- See the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section for the reading material. -->
	The relative weightage is given below.
	<p><dl><dd>
	<ul>
	<li>Paper presentation (20%)</li>
	<li>Participation (10%)</li>
	</ul>
</dd></dl></p>
See the <a href="#papers">Interesting Papers</a> section for a list of recent papers.
</dd>
</dl></p>
	
	<p><dl>
	<dt>Research / FreeRTOS project (60%)</dt>
	<dd>The research project must be done in teams of 1-3.
	The goal of the research project is to conduct original research.
	You may talk to the instructor for some ideas that are well-scoped for a
	course project.
	You may also undertake a project overlapping with your own research, if you can
	demonstrate how it is related to and/or influenced by some topic from this
	course.
	The deliverables for a research project and their relative weightage is given below.
	You must submit a <em>fully functional and reproducible artifact</em> along with the final report.
	<p><dl><dd>
		<ul>
		<li>Proposal presentation (5%)</li>
		<li>Proposal report (15%)</li>
		<li>Final presentation (10%)</li>
		<li>Final report and artifact (30%)</li>
		</ul>
	</dd></dl></p>
	<span style="background-color:#FFFF00">You may choose to do the FreeRTOS project instead of a research project.
	Undergraduates, especially, may (and are recommended to) choose this option.</span>
	This will involve understanding the internals of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system kernel,
	extending it to support the <em>Earliest Deadline First</em> dynamic-priority scheduling algorithm,
	the <em>Stack Resource Policy</em> for real-time locking, and the <em>Constant Bandwidth Server</em>
	for co-scheduling real-time periodic and non-real-time aperiodic tasks.
	The underlying scheduling theory for each of the assignments will be taught during the first half of the course,
	or else extensive documentation and help will be provided.
	These tentative programming assignments and their relative weightage is summarized below.
	Like the research project, you must also submit a <em>fully functional and reproducible artifact</em> along with each assignment submission.
	<!-- Remember that a substantial percentage of your grade will be assigned during the demos, so prepare a nice demo! -->
	<p><dl><dd>
		<ul>
		<li>Presentation on FreeRTOS internals (5%)</li>
		<li>Earliest Deadline First (EDF) (15%)</li>
		<li>Stack Resource Policy (SRP) (15%)</li>
		<li>Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) (15%)</li>
		<li>Final Demo (10%)</li>

<h2>Project</h2>

<a name="freertos"></a>
<h3>Research Project (Option 1)</h3>

<p>You must propose a research project with a problem statment and a research
	plan, conduct the research, and write up your research results and experience.
	If you need any specific equipment, software, or tools for your project,
	please speak to us as soon as possible.</p>
	
	<p>It is okay if you do not complete a full-fledged project by the end of the term.
	The goal is to learn how to go from a one-line problem to a fully scoped out
	research problem, then try and identify potential solutions.
	If a topic is difficult and you do not reach the practical implementation stage,
	that will be fine.</p>
	
	
	<p>
	There are four deliverables in the project.
	Each written component must be formatted using the
	<a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author">LIPIcs style template</a>.
	You are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX for typesetting.
	</p>
	
	<p><dl>
	<dt>Research Proposal</dt>
	<dd>The proposal should be minimally four pages (excluding references)
	and must include the following sections.
	<p><dl><dd>
		<ul>
		<li>Introduction: Explain what is the problem, why is it an important
		problem, and why are you interested in this problem? Describe the background
		and motivation for the problem you are interested in, and pose a concrete
		research question.</li>
		<li>Related work: Do a brief survey of related work in the problem space.
		This includes papers that solve the same problem but with a different
		approach and papers whose ideas you build upon in your own work. Compare and
		contrast your own proposed solution with each related work. If you have not
		read all the related work by the time of proposal submission, make a list of
		papers that you will be covering by the final report submission.</li>
		<li>Proposed solution: Describe your proposed solution and planned
		methodology to answer the research question at a high level.</li>
		<li>Evaluation: Describe how you plan to evaluate your proposed solution.
		What kind of data, plots, or proofs artifacts would you generate from the
		evaluation?</li>
		</ul>
	</dd></dl></p>
	</dd>
	</dl></p>
	
	<p><dl>
	<dt>Proposal Presentation</dt>
	<dd>Each group will give a short presentation followed by Q&A and feedback from the class. Focus on presenting:
	<p><dl><dd>
		<ul>
		<li>Problem: What is the problem they are working on? (Include the basic context that is required to understand the problem statement.)</li>
		<li>Motivation: Why is an important problem and why did you choose to work on this problem?</li>
		<li>Key idea: What is the key idea of your solution?</li>
		<li>Deliverable: What is the expected final deliverable?</li>
		</ul>
	</dd></dl></p>
	</dd>
	</dl></p>
	
	<p><dl>
	<dt>Final Presentation</dt>
	<dd>Each group will give a short presentation followed by Q&A from
	the class. The presentation would be similar to a conference or workshop talk.
	Focus on presenting the motivation, the problem, one key idea of your project,
	and the results.</dd>
	</dl></p>
	
	<p><dl>
	<dt>Final Report</dt>
	<dd>The final report must include similar sections as in the proposal but written
	in a way to describe what has been done. Additionally, add a section describing
	the limitations of your work and how the research can be extended (by you or
	someone else) in the future.</dd>
